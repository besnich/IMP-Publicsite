NCG has run hundreds of command centers for clients in different industries, sizes, and complexity for event coordination, deployment, incident response.  This experience has given us great insight into what works and what does not for what needs to be communicated, how to manage efforts, how to coordinate people.  We have practical experience and lessons learned on how to capture the level of detail to support recovery efforts with legal, law enforcement, insurers, and other key external parties. IMP has and continues to be developed based on this past experience and NCG's current work efforts in the system and security fields.
