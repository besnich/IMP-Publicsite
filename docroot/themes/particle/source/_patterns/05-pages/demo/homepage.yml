    block_title: Why IMP is needed…
    block_body: Existing incident management tools tend to be either very rudimentary applications not much beyond a glorified spreadsheet.  While others are part of complex systems   that are very hard to use in the middle of an incident. Our clients faced many frustrations trying to find automation that could help them manage incidents and all the data and information associated with those activities. The automation available had quite a few challenges:
    block_list:
      items:
        - item_text: Too expensive and complicated to use
        - item_text: Too hard to use or not rigorous enough
        - item_text: Too rigid or not structured enough
        - item_text: To open or too closed
        - item_text: Too generic or too specific
        - item_text:  Not tied to industry standards like NIST or FBI evidence handling reporting—and thus requiring expensive gathering and collecting of data after the fact.

    block_title: NCG and the Orchestration Platform
    block_body: Northcross Group (NCG) is an integration and cybersecurity firm working in both the public and private sector.  NCG has helped many clients build automation to meet specific business needs, like incident management because challenges out grew paper and spreadsheet methods and existing software was too generic, complicated, or expensive. NCG has run hundreds of command centers for clients in different industries, sizes, and complexity for event coordination, deployment, incident response.  This experience has given us great insight into what works and what does not for what needs to be communicated, how to manage efforts, how to coordinate people.  We have practical experience and lessons learned on how to capture the level of detail to support recovery efforts with legal, law enforcement, insurers, and other key external parties. IMP has and continues to be developed based on this past experience and NCG's current work efforts in the system and security fields.  IMP is supported by NCG subject matter experts to provide not only application support, but real world expertise in managing incidents.

    block_body: IMP is hosted securely in the cloud so you don't have to worry software installation,
                maintenance, or upgrades on your infrastructure. Each IMP instance is its own container
                with only your information in it. Your data is segmented from others and protected by
                application hardening, data encryption at rest, active monitoring, and other controls to
                protect your data and information.
                Users access IMP through a current browser such as Firefox, Chrome, Safari, or Internet
                Explorer from a phone, tablet, or PC. The connection between your browser and IMP is
                encrypted and IMP does not store any data on the device you are using.
                Your organization's system administrator has the ability to manage users and groups in
                IMP. Your administrator can add or remove users to comply with your own user
                management policies and procedures.

    block_body: Part of effective incident response is to have a general
                 awareness of how to identify an incident and expectations
                 of what needs to be done to address the situation and
                 recover from it. We offer general incident management
                 training and how to use IMP to support those efforts. We
                 offer training customization to fit your particular
                 organization and industry as well.
                 IMP training is available onsite in a classroom setting, or
                 virtually. On-demand and refresher training is also available.
